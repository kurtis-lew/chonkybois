 This is the home of the Chonky Bois ergo split keyboard models.
 Here you can find 3d models that once printed, fit alps or mx switches, a trss connector and a pro-micro and after some handwiring magic you can head over to my qmk fork for an example of a keymap/ 

 
** Lil Chonky
What started with the Big Chonky evolved into a more petite size.

For this one I wrote a quick port of Matt Adereth's dactyl code to generate the shape of the keywells and the shape of the cavities for the switches. The intention is that one can model a basic shape around the generated keywell shapes.
I added a pinky rotation option as I found it to be very comfortable on the Absolem keyboard.
