* Lil Chonky Bois.

#+CAPTION: Lil Chonky in ALps and MX version. 
[[./img/IMG_3475.jpg]]

This is the case design for the Lil Chonky Bois, the successor of the original Chonky Boi, which has been moved to the archive.
The Chonky Bois come in different flavors, i.e. wired and wireless. The wireless version accomodates the [[https://store.jpconstantineau.com/#/group/bluemicro][bluemicro840 v1.x]] and the [[https://store.jpconstantineau.com/#/group/bluemicro][bluemacro840 v1.x]]. Rumor has it that the Nice!Nanos are going to be in stock again in the nearnear future, when I can get a hold of a couple, I will update this repo with a holder for the nice!nano, providing the original promicro holder will not suffice.
Furthermore, MX hotswap and ALPS mountplate versions are provided.

* Hot Swap
Having started with handwired alps keyboards, repurposing AEKII switches, I turned my nose up to hotswappable keyboards. This was wrong, like very wrong. What I did not know at the time was how rich and diverse the MX switch landscape had become. At the time I only had silent white alps and if I looked far and wide on the internet, maybe, just maybe I could find a batch of affordable blue or orange alps. Three types of switches was managable.

When I made an MX version I quickly fell into a rabbit hole of blues (yuck), browns (oof), yellows (hello), glorious pandas (wat) and black inks (fuyooo) and I have barely scratched the surface. No, like lubing and filming your switches, I now consider hotswap to be *mandatory* for any keyboard enthousiast. I manage to solder a set in roughly two hours and my back hates it, if I see a nice switch set on ali (I see you tecsee purples) I do not want to think about breathing soldering fumes for another evening. No, I want to think about the taste of krytox 205g0 on my fingers instead ! /s

* Extras
Fo conveniece, several wrist rests are provided in a separate blend file, the gel version has also been exported as an stl. Please note that I am using some weird rubber feet I found in a craft store, sold by the pound and you will need to accomodate accordingly.
