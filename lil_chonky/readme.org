* Lil Chonky v 1.1

#+CAPTION: Lil Chonky in ALps and MX version.

This is the next iteration of the original lil Chonkster, after using the previous incarnation for a couple of months I decided to ease the tenting and I found I needed a little less curvature of the keywell. After some testing I also adapted the thumbcluster a little. Pictured are the Alps and the MX version, the thumbcluster is designed for 1.75u keycaps and for MX keys these are harder to come by than imagined. In the BOM is a link to an ALI store that allows you to order any format, but 1.75u is calculated as having the price of 4x 1u.

Strictly speaking this is not part of the design, but it is part of my build. During the design iterations I changed cases a number of times and I got real sick of the resoldering. Not so much the work itself, but I felt there was a real degradation happening with each resolder.
I found an example of somebody using small rivets in stead of the mil-max connectors. The plan is to put a small rivet over one of the legs of a switch, use pliers to squash the rivet on the leg. Then comes the intersting bit, this squashed rivet will too easily come off, now you must remove the rivet from the leg and give it an extra squeeze. Too hard and it will not go over the leg again, too little, it will come loose too easily, repeat until a healthy friction fit is achieved.
